## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Nesting

### What I learned

I used this exercise to familiarize myself with CSS Nesting. There is a different approach involved when writing the code. Especially in making sure I do the nesting correctly, maintain a high readability and don't take the nesting too deep.

### Continued development

I sure need to get more familiarized with nesting and deepdive in the [MDN Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Nesting).

### Useful resources

- [Getting started with CSS Nesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Xp1QgNkhU) - Who else but Kevin Powell would be introducing me to CSS Nesting.
